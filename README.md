# MotherboardSampleProject

Sample project w/ On-Board LED and Switches.
The program reads from RAM, and using that value lights up the LED's based on the bits.

You need to turn on the respective switches, after which the LED's will turn off.
The program restarts again when you turn off all the switches and a new LED combination will show up.
